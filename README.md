# ðŸš€ Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet Journey

Welcome to my coding grind!  
This repo holds my solutions to **Striverâ€™s SDE Sheet** â€“ one of the most popular DSA roadmaps for cracking coding interviews.  

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside?
- Solutions organized by **Day-XX** (same as the sheet).  
- Each problem solved mainly in **C++**, with comments on logic & complexity.  
- Mix of brute force â†’ optimized approaches where possible.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo?
- Keep myself accountable while solving the sheet.  
- Build a handy **revision hub** for interviews.  
- Share approaches that might help others stuck on a problem.  

## âœ… Progress
Iâ€™m updating as I go â€” think of it as my **DSA adventure log**.  
Check back for more problems, cleaner code, and maybe some new tricks.

âœ¨ If youâ€™re on the same grind, feel free to fork this repo and compare your approaches.  
Letâ€™s crack DSA, one problem at a time.
